# Background-Changer-Responsive-B
One button included to change the whole background color.
# Why this project?
Because most of the websites have different kinds of color changer themes included.
# What you really did in this project?
I firstly added three files "HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT".
Then I write the title and add the button through "BOOTSTRAP BUTTON" and change the title into my own.
Give an inline function because in this project we need only one event for the mouse click.
Moving forward to CSS , I just centralized div.
Then Javascript, "index" to global variable.
function to call "changeColors()" then input var to give them array in different colors.
call the function out of the body which is "0" and change the background color through styling CSS.
To repeatedly perform an action I included "if" statement.
